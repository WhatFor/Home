    <h2>My opinions</h2>
    <p>
        This is somewhere for me to lay down my thoughts on things. They're not
        quite blog posts, more living documents that I can use to get my
        feelings straight and share them in the process. Don't take them too
        seriously, but if you do want to talk about anything you read, see my
        contact info <a href="stuff.html">somewhere here</a>.

        I intended for this post to be quite straightforward and short... It
        wasn't.
