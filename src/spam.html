    <h2>My dear friend</h2>
    <pre>
Even though I'm not at my strongest right now due to illness, I
didn't want to let this moment pass without reaching out. I've
been reflecting and believe I have a proposal that could be
mutually rewarding and lead to truly meaningful results.

If you're open to hearing me out, I'd be honored to share more
with you. And, if I may ask, could you kindly confirm your full
name for me? I like to keep things personal and address people as
God intended—by name, with respect and sincerity.

Looking forward to your thoughts.
Miss lynn
