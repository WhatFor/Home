    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
        I'm Chris, UTC+0:00. I have lots of strong
        <a href="opinions.html">opinions</a> about technology and the web. I
        work as a Principal Developer for money, where I gain a lot of
        satisfaction through teaching.

        This website is my digital garden; I draw a lot of inspiration from
        <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/">Maggie Appleton</a> and the
        <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>.
