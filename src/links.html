        See
        <a href="https://whatforever.dev/public/">www.whatforever.dev</a> for a
        comprehensive, eternally-available list of the articles I have read. The
        goal here is to ensure the links are available to read for as long as
        possible! If something of yours is archived and you don't want it to be,
        please feel free to contact me at
